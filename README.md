# spotphish

We have built two kind of models for spotphish https://github.com/spotphish/spotphish
1. ##### Classification model - Model is trained on popular websites login pages. Spotphish uses it to make decision based on look and feel of the page.
2. ##### Object detection model - Model is trained on logos of popular websites. Spotphish uses it to identify the brand.

These models were built by IIT Mumbai CS students as part of their internship at Coriolis Technologies.
